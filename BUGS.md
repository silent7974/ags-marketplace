- [ ] SellerNavbar profile image and first name not updating until I enter the profile settings page and load it
- [ ] In Profile settings page, the delete button does not clear the deleted seller products from the database
- [ ] The sidebar triggered by the hamburger menu should feel bouncy (ease in out back animation)
- [ ] Products related data UI should be stored in a redux slice
- [ ] There should be a size guide in products add/edit pages
- [ ] Category in both products add/edit pages should not be fetched from 'sellerToken' but from the sellerProfileSlice.js
